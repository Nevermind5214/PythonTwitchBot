# Twitch bot written in Python

It has a custom dictionary type that mirrors itself to a json file, cool AF but please help me with the bugs because OOP is hard.

It is under developement so please be kind.

The bot needs a config.json file next to it with the contents of:
```
{
    "username": "the bots username",
    "token": "twitch token of the bot",
    "channel": "channel to connenct to",
    "starter_keksz": 2,
    "minutes_to_earn_keksz": 30
}
```
